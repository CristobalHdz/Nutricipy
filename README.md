# Section 01: Description
This application will use a Body Mass Index(BMI) API to calculate the suggested calorie intake, this information will be used with a diet API that will display recipes based on their recommended threshold. The application will receive individual filters to narrow the results displaying in an easy to use interface.

The goal of this application is to help the user keep track of their diet based on their personal life needs and dietary restrictions providing them a wide variety of nutritional options. This way the user can expand their menu without sacrificing their well being but yet enjoying appetizing flavourful options.
